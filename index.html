    <h2><b>About</b></h2>
    <p>Svenja Guhr is a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://fortext.org/en/">fortext lab</a> 
      and has an academic background in German literature, Romance linguistics, and Digital Humanities. 
      As a computational literary studies scholar, her PhD project focused on the operationalization 
      and analysis of sound and loudness as narratological phenomena in German-language literary prose of the 19th and early 20th century. </p>

    <h3>Book Project</h3> 
    <h4><i>Raise Your Voice! - Character Sound in German-Language Fiction</i></h4>
    <p>Sound is omnipresent in our everyday lives and also in literary texts, fictional sounds create the soundscapes of fictional worlds.</p>
    <p>In July 2024, I signed my book contract with Metzler/Springer Nature for the publication of my monograph <i>Raise Your Voice!</i>. It will be published in the book series "Digitale Literaturwissenschaft" ("Digital Literary Studies") in Spring 2025. 
      It will be a gold open-access publication that I could realize thanks to the financial support of Women in Science of the Humanities Department of the Technical University of Darmstadt, 
      the Association of Digital Humanities in the German-speaking area, and the TU Darmstadt Open Access Publication Fonds for English publications.</p>

    <h5>theme-d-Prose</h5>
    <p>The corpus "theme-d-Prose 1848-1920" is a collection of 1.227 German-language literary prose texts published between 1848 and 1920.
      It is an extended subcorpus of "d-Prose 1870-1920" (Gius/Guhr/Adelmann 2021), which is the source of 804 of its text files.
      In terms of social and literary history, the selected publication period (1848-1920) covers a time of many political changes 
      in the German-speaking area with a diverse literary production that can retrospectively be grouped into the following major literary movements and epochs: 
      the end of pre-March and the Biedermeier, Realism, Naturalism, Modernism, and Expressionism. 
    <a href="https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.12666499">The corpus is published on Zenodo (Version 1.0 from July 2024).</a></p>
      
    <h5>d-Prose</h5>
    <p>The corpus “d-Prose 1870-1920” is a heterogeneous collection of 2.511 German-language literary prose texts published between 1870 and 1920. 
    It contains narrative texts from trivial and high literature with a minimum length of 1000 words. 
    The corpus was created from manually and semi-automatically selected texts from the German-speaking area.</p>
    <a href="https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4315208">The corpus is published on Zenodo (Version 2.0 from June 2021).</a></p>
